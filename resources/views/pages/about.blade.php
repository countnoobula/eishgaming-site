            <p>EGN - Eish Gaming Network, as the name suggests, is a Local South African gaming community that started in 2008. Since its creation, it has grown into an online presence that saw its debut as a Facebook Group. Since then, we have grown to over 150 members and we have a really versatile community that plays everything from old school 8 bit games to the latest high speed FPS and recently, table top games such as Yugioh and Magic TG.</p>

            <h3>Dylan Vorster</h3>

            <p><b>Web Development, Graphics, Admin</b><br /><br />Dylan is 8 bit obsessed, he loves strategy games and believes his sole purpose in life is to build state-of the art systems that just do things better. When he is not gaming, he is working on projects, and when he isn't doing any of those things, he is raging at Rory because some or other code is not split into multiple lines.</p>

            <h3>Rory van Heerden</h3>

            <p><b>Web Development, Server Admin</b><br /><br />Rory knows Linux better than you know how to speak english, or let alone breath for that matter. When Rory is not typing in the console, he is drinking coffee or raging at Dylan's idea of breaking code up into multiple lines.</p>
